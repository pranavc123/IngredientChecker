### IngredientChecker

## GENERAL STEPS
Research harmful ingredients: Before creating the tool, you need to know what harmful ingredients to look out for. There are many resources online that can help you identify common harmful ingredients in beauty products. Some popular ones include parabens, sulfates, formaldehyde, phthalates, and fragrance.

Gather data: Once you have a list of harmful ingredients, you need to gather data on which beauty products contain them. You can start by manually compiling a list of products and their ingredients, or you can use databases and APIs that provide this information.

Choose a programming language: To create the web tool, you'll need to choose a programming language that you're comfortable with. Some popular choices for web development include JavaScript, Python, and Ruby.

Build the web tool: You can use a variety of web development frameworks and libraries to build the tool. Some popular ones include React, Angular, and Vue.js for front-end development, and Django and Flask for back-end development. You'll need to design the user interface, create the search functionality, and program the logic for checking product ingredients against the harmful ingredients list.

Test the web tool: Once the tool is built, you'll need to test it thoroughly to ensure that it's functioning as expected. Test different scenarios, edge cases, and user input to make sure that the tool is accurate and reliable.

Deploy the web tool: After testing, you can deploy the tool to a web server or hosting service so that it can be accessed by users online. Make sure that the tool is secure and that user data is protected.

Market the web tool: Once the tool is deployed, you can start marketing it to potential users. You can use social media, search engine optimization, and advertising to reach your target audience.
